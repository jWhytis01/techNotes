Special characters ignored if in quotes
$ (dollar sign), \ (backslash), and ` (back tick). 

Parameter, arithmetic and command expansion all will happen in double quotes.
All special characters are suppressed by single quotes.
\ lets you escape  a single special character \$ \\ \`
\ also is used to mark control codes


Movement in the shell
ctl-a Begin line
ctl-E end line
ctl-f right arrow
ctl-b left arrow
alt-f right arrow one word
atl-b left arrow one word

Security

id 		- display user id
chmod 	- change files properties
umask 	- set the default file permissions
su 		- run a shell as another user
sudo 	- execute a command as another user or u using your superuser creds
chown 	- change a file owner
chgrp	- change a files group ownership
passwd	- change a users password

Directories need read and execute to be entered

Thinking thru User/Group/Everyone permissions

Users/Groups are maintained in the etc files.
Where are the relationships stored.

setuid bit oct 4000 sets the effective user id.  Runs as a spesified user, not the user running the program
	ie run as super user

setgid bit oct 2000 changes effective group id, user running does not need to be in group

sticky bit - oct 1000 when applied to a directory means only owner of dir or file or SU can change the file

User Permissions
					Sys		User	Group	World
							 rwx	 rwx	 rwx
Under the Covers	0000 	0000 	0000 	0000
Bits set with dec			7		6		4
					0000	0111	0110	0100
Bits set with Symbols *

Symbols: Hier 	u - user, g - group, o - other (world), a all.
Symbols: Perm	r - read, w - write, x - execute
Symbols: Oper	+ - add permission - - remove permission = - add permission
	Oper used with hier impact that hier
	Oper used with no hier specified default to a - all.

Symbols - System
s - applied to User or Group changing effective permissions, t - limits write/delete
u+s - setuid - Oct 4000 sets the effective user, usually to admin
g+s - setgid - Oct 2000 sets the effective group
 +t - sticky bit - Prevents anyone but owner, group owner or root from writing/deleting the file
