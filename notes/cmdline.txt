the alternatives is esentially a way to alias programs
I'm wondeing if it is a best practice to put everything installed here.

https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.pdf

Is there such a thing as the registry on linux? No, config is in the /etc directory and a users home directory.  Other places are possible but this is where to start.

 1082  # The ~/bin directory is a good place to put scripts intended for personal use. If we write a script that everyone on a system is allowed to use, the traditional location is /usr/local/bin. Scripts intended for use by the system administrator are often located in /usr/local/sbin. In most cases, locally supplied software, whether scripts or compiled programs, should be placed in the /usr/local hierarchy and not in /bin or /usr/bin. These directories are specified by the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard to contain only files supplied and maintained by the Linux distributor.

 1083  # CONFIGURING VIM FOR SCRIPT WRITING

 1084  The vim text editor has many, many configuration settings. Several common options can facilitate script writing.

 1085  :syntax on turns on syntax highlighting. With this setting, different elements of shell syntax will be displayed in different colors when viewing a script. This is helpful for identifying certain kinds of programming errors. It looks cool, too. Note that for this feature to work, you must have a complete version of vim installed, and the file you are editing must have a shebang indicating the file is a shell script. If you have difficulty with :syntax on, try :set syntax=sh instead.

 1086  :set hlsearch turns on the option to highlight search results. Say we search for the word echo. With this option on, each instance of the word will be high- lighted.

 1087  :set tabstop=4 sets the number of columns occupied by a tab character. The default is eight columns. Setting the value to 4 (which is a common prac- tice) allows long lines to fit more easily on the screen.

 1088  :set autoindent turns on the auto indent feature. This causes vim to indent a new line the same amount as the line just typed. This speeds up typing on many kinds of programming constructs. To stop indentation, type CTRL-D.

 1089  These changes can be made permanent by adding these commands (with- out the leading colon characters) to your ~/.vimrc file.

 1929  # traps can be used to clean up temp files
 1930  # in naming temp files it is important to realize they can be attacked
 1931  # While the scenario is a bit essoteric it is possible.
 1932  # here are some file naming tips
 1933  # One way to create a non-predictable (but still descriptive) name is to do some- thing like this:
 1934  tempfile=/tmp/$(basename $0).$$.$RANDOM
 1935  This will create a filename consisting of the program’s name, followed by its process ID (PID), followed by a random integer. Note, however, that the $RANDOM shell variable returns a value only in the range of 1 to 32767, which is not a very large range in computer terms, so a single instance of the variable is not sufficient to overcome a determined attacker.
 1936  A better way is to use the mktemp program (not to be confused with the mktemp standard library function) to both name and create the temporary file.
